Helpful notes on running the app, database connection etc.
-----------------
For use on your localhost
-----------------
First make sure you have a clean sequelized database...
>>sequelize db:migrate:undo:all
>>sequelize db:migrate
>>sequelize db:seed:all

*****make sure to edit config.json if you have pulled recently***********
*****config.json needs to point to the database on your local machine****

-----------------
For production use on Heroku using jawsDB database
-----------------
****to get the database seeded
****edit config.json
change the fields in the heroku object to use whatever credentials
go with the jawsDB database associated with the heroku app

you can find these under the heroku account apps page, click on jawsDB
this will take you to the hostname, username, password, and database name you 
must input into the appropriate fields.

These do *not* get pushed to github as the credentials allow anyone to manipulate our
database

git add/commit/heroku push, then do whatever sequelize tasks
you need to do.  
***Make sure you take out the credentials and
replace with something innocuous then git add/commit/push again
so as not to expose to the public.****

For seeding jawsDB using the command line shell on your local computer:
heroku login and provide the correct credentials
double check that you're in the correct area, git remote -v
then use whatever Sequelize commands you need to but specify the environment like so--

sequelize db:migrate --env heroku

in the above line, heroku corresponds to the json object found in config.json, the file that 
sequelize naturally looks for
