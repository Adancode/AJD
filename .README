Helpful notes on running the app, database connection etc.
-----------------
For use on your localhost
-----------------
First make sure you have a clean sequelized database...
>>sequelize db:migrate:undo:all
>>sequelize db:migrate
>>sequelize db:seed:all

then you MUST edit the two tables, mentees and mentors:
run a regular mysql query on the database you're hitting or edit using whatever mysql manager you're using
USE mydb;
ALTER TABLE mentees ADD created_at DATETIME;
ALTER TABLE mentees ADD updated_at DATETIME;
ALTER TABLE mentors ADD created_at DATETIME;
ALTER TABLE mentors ADD updated_at DATETIME;

You are adding new columns updated_at and created_at due to a bug in Sequelize.  
This is a temporary workaround

*****make sure to edit config.json if you have pulled recently*****


-----------------
For production use on Heroku using jawsDB database
-----------------
in config.json, change the fields in heroku to use whatever credentials
go with the jawsDB database associated with the heroku app
git add/commit/heroku push, then do whatever sequelize tasks
you need to do.  Make sure you take out the credentials and
replace with something innocuous then git add/commit/push again
so as not to expose to the public.

For seeding jawsDB using the command line shell on your local computer:
heroku login and provide the correct credentials
double check that you're in the correct area, git remote -v
then use whatever Sequelize commands you need to but specify the environment like so--

sequelize db:migrate --env heroku

in the above line, heroku corresponds to the json object found in config.json, the file that 
sequelize naturally looks for
